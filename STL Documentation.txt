About STL : The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

About the project : The project done by team members is mind blowing. 

The Header Files : STL contains 4 types of header files 
1.Iterators
2.Containers
3.Algorithms
4.Functors
	In the project, we have covered the first 3.

Containers : 
1. vector.h :
	Functions of vector :
2. stack.h :
	Functions of vector :
3. queue.h : 
	Functions of vector :
